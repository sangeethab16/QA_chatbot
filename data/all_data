Training set http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/datasets/hotpot/hotpot_train_v1.1.json
Dev set in the distractor setting http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/datasets/hotpot/hotpot_dev_distractor_v1.json
Dev set in the fullwiki setting http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/datasets/hotpot/hotpot_dev_fullwiki_v1.json This is just hotpot_dev_distractor_v1.json without the gold paragraphs, but instead with the top 10 paragraphs obtained using our retrieval system. If you want to use your own IR system (which is encouraged!), you can replace the paragraphs in this json with your own retrieval results. Please note that the gold paragraphs might or might not be in this json because our IR system is pretty basic.
Test set in the fullwiki setting http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/datasets/hotpot/hotpot_test_fullwiki_v1.json Because in the fullwiki setting, you only need to submit your prediction to our evaluation server without the code, we publish the test set without the answers and supporting facts. The context in the file is paragraphs obtained using our retrieval system, which might or might not contain the gold paragraphs. Again you are encouraged to use your own IR system in this setting --- simply replace the paragraphs in this json with your own retrieval results.
